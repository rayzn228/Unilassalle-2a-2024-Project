Farm Debt Analysis
Introduction
This project aims to analyze the factors influencing farm debt levels, focusing on the impact of different farm characteristics such as size, production type, location, and farmer demographics (age and sex). The analysis is crucial given the rising farm debts in France and the increasing number of farmers living below the poverty line.

Objectives
Identify the types of farms most affected by debt.
Examine the role of farm characteristics (size, production type, location) in financial burdens.
Assess the impact of farmer demographics (age, sex) on debt levels.
Understand the influence of environmental constraints (e.g., Natura 2000 zones) on farm debts.
Data Source
The data used in this project is sourced from the Réseau d’Information Comptable Agricole (RICA), a survey conducted annually by each member state of the European Union since 1968. The dataset includes a variety of quantitative and qualitative characteristics to assess the diversity of incomes in the agricultural sector.

Methodology
Data Selection
Production Type: Focused on farms with the largest amount of debt. The largest mean debt was found in "Mixed farming operations with granivores".
Quantitative Factors: Total area of the farm, revenues, and debt quantity.
Qualitative Factors: Age and sex of the farmer, presence of the farm in a Natura 2000 Zone.
Analysis
Impact of Farm Size and Revenue on Debt:

Test: Linear Regression
Variables: Surface area, revenues (independent), debt amount (dependent)
Impact of Farmer's Sex on Debt:

Test: Welch two-sample t-test
Variables: Gender of farm owner (independent), debt amount (dependent)
Impact of Farmer's Age on Debt:

Hypothesis: Older farmers may manage debt better due to experience; younger farmers may manage debt better due to modern education and information access.
Analysis: Boxplot visualization and statistical testing.
Impact of Environmental Constraints on Debt:

Test: Wilcoxon rank sum test
Variables: Presence in Natura 2000 Zone (independent), debt amount (dependent)
Results
Larger farms generally have more debt due to higher investment in expansion and susceptibility to market and environmental risks.
No significant difference in debt levels between male and female farmers, though variability suggests potential influences beyond gender.
No relationship between the age range of the farmer manager and the quantity of farm debt.
Farms in Natura 2000 zones do not have significantly different debt levels compared to those outside these zones.
Conclusions
Farm size and revenue are significant factors in farm debt levels.
Gender and age do not significantly impact farm debt levels.
Environmental constraints (Natura 2000 zones) do not significantly affect farm debt levels.
Limitations
Analysis focused on only one production type.
Limited qualitative data due to the exclusion of social factors.
Further multivariate analysis is required for a more comprehensive understanding.
